	Quizes: Layer States and Conditionals. 

	Make four programs. 

		1.	A toggle button. 
			A button that switches between two (or more) states when clicked.
		
		2.	Two (or more) toggle buttons that behave the same way.
			Each button can be toggled independently of the others. 
			Think of them like a set of options that can be individually checked or unchecked. 

		3.	Two (or more) toggle buttons that, when ALL are selected, somthing else happens.
			Each button can be toggled independently like before. 
			But, if both (or all) of the buttons are toggled on (or selected), something new happens.

		4.	A set of radio buttons.
			A radio button set is a set of toggle buttons (two or more) where only one can be selected at a time. 
			By default, none of the buttons are selected, and clicking a button selects it. 
			After that, selecting a different button causes the previous selection to become unselected. 

	Optional challenge:

		(5). Options.
			Create a set of toggle buttons with labels. 
			Depending on the combinations of selections, something different is displayed.
