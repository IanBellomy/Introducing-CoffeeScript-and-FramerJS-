######################## P6
# Layers that are animating will emit an AnimationEnd event when the animation is complete.
# In other frameworks, a function that is called after a process is complete is sometimes named a "callback". 

box = new Layer

box.on Events.AnimationEnd, ->		# You can add the an AnimationEnd event handler any time before the animation is complete. But it's safest to add it before you start the animation.
	print "TA-DA!"
	
box.animate
	rotation:180

######################## P7
# The ability to respond to an animation end is useful for chaining animations.
# However, it can be a good idea to use .once() instead of .on() in these situations

box = new Layer

box.once Events.AnimationEnd, ->	# If we used .on() instead of .once(), then this function would be called after the x animation ran, and after than, and after that, and after that...
	@animate
		x:300

box.onMouseDown ->
	@animate
		y:180
