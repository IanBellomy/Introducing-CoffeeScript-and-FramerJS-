	Each video demonstrates an interactive behavior. 
	For each video, create a small program that produces the behavior.

	The black circle that appears around the cursor indicates a click.
	It is not part of the program.

	TIPS:
		Center a layer in the window with the layer's center() method.
		
			box = new Layer
			box.center()

		Use a normal cursor with the following code:
		
			document.body.style.cursor = "auto"
