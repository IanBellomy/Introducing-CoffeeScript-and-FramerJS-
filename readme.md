## Materials for Learning / Teaching CoffeeScript and FramerJS

These materials walk through fundemental programming concepts using CoffeeScript. 
Each file has further instructions.

The goals of these materials are:

- *Solid Foundations*. Learning exactly what the code means is more tedious and dry in the beginning, but prevents hair pulling and unnecessary frustration later. A solid foundation allows students/designers to spend more time using the langauge to explore ideas and make decisions, and less time trying to make things compile. I go deeper than necessary in some cases because I find that it helps reinforce the more common, important, and simpler core concepts. 

- *Clarify Concepts vs. Syntax* (Where Possible). I assume that my students know nothing about programming. I try to note when an idiom is specific to CoffeeScript, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, or to programming langauges in general.
