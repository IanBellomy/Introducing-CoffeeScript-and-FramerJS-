## Materials for Learning / Teaching CoffeeScript and FramerJS

These materials walk through fundemental programming concepts using CoffeeScript and FramerJS. 
Each file has further instructions.

The goals of these materials are:

- *Solid Foundations*. Learning exactly what the code means is more tedious and dry in the beginning, but prevents hair pulling and unnecessary frustration later. A solid foundation allows students/designers to spend more time using the langauge to explore ideas and make decisions, and less time trying to make things compile. I assume that my students know nothing and begin at the beginning. I also go deeper than necessary in some cases because I find that it helps reinforce the more common, important, and simpler core concepts. (It gives expereinced students more to sharpen their teeth on if the class has a range of skill levels!) 

- *Clarify Concepts vs. Syntax* (Where Possible). Ideally, I'd like students learn concepts they can take to other places. So I try to note when an idiom is specific to CoffeeScript, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, or to programming langauges in general.


I've _just_ finished using this specific material for the first time so there's plenty of rough edges.
