## Materials for Learning / Teaching CoffeeScript and FramerJS

These materials walk through fundamental programming concepts using CoffeeScript and FramerJS. 

Intended use: Lessons are numbered; Open the first pdf; Follow the instructions; Move to the next. 

In reality, I supplement each section with a lecture and goofy activities. Unfortunately I don't have recordings of these. 

I assume my students know nothing and begin at the beginning. Learning exactly what the code means is more tedious and dry in the beginning but prevents hair pulling and unnecessary frustration later. A solid foundation allows students/designers to spend more time using the language to explore ideas and make decisions and less time trying to make things run. It's also provides a vocabulary for talking about techniques.

I prioritize concepts that I feel are most relevant to UI prototpying and event-based programming. The initial topics include data and functions. Loops and conditionals *are* covered, but later, and as optional topics. (Yes loopa are a super important programming topic, but they just aren't that important when it comes to prototyping UI stuff.) With a solid understanding of data and functions a student is prepared for basic event-based programming and can do a lot of basic prototyping work. If students run into situations where they need to, for example, "make this button do different things at different times" they can be directed to the appropriate optional section (on conditionals or loops and arrays).
