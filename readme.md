## Materials for Learning / Teaching CoffeeScript and FramerJS

These materials walk through fundamental programming concepts using CoffeeScript and FramerJS. 
Each file has further instructions.

The goals of these materials are:

- *Solid Foundations*. I assume that my students know nothing and begin at the beginning. Learning exactly what the code means is more tedious and dry in the beginning but prevents hair pulling and unnecessary frustration later. A solid foundation allows students/designers to spend more time using the language to explore ideas and make decisions and less time trying to make things run. A solid foundation is also a foundation for communication. Techniques are almost impossible to explain if basic ideas, concepts, terms are not understood. 

- *Space to Run*. Most classes have a range of skills. While I start at the beginning, I go deeper than necessary in some cases so that experienced students can sharpen their teeth. Having students go deeper then necessary can also help reinforce more core concepts.The sequenced structure allows students to work at their own pace and ask questions as needed.  

- *Clarify Concepts vs. Language behaviors* (Where Possible). Ideally, I'd like students learn concepts they can take to other places. So I try to note when an idiom is specific to CoffeeScript, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, or to programming languages in general.
