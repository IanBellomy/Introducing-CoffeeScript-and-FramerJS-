## Materials for Learning / Teaching CoffeeScript and FramerJS

These materials walk through fundemental programming concepts using CoffeeScript. 
Each file has further instructions.

The goals of these materials are:

- *Solid Foundations*. Learning exactly what the code means is more tedious and dry in the beginning, but prevents hair pulling and unnecessary frustration later. A solid foundation allows students/designers to spend more time using the langauge to explore ideas and make decisions, and less time trying to make things compile. I go deeper than necessary in some cases because I find that it helps reinforce the more common, important, and simpler core concepts. 

- *Get To the Point*. FramerJS provides the basic tools for quick interface prototyping: A display hierarchy, cartesian-cooridnate based layout, events, scrolling, and triggered animations. (Bonus: There's a shortcut for dragging.) To work with these concepts, it is essential to understand data, objects, and functions. It is not essential to understand loops, arrays and conditionals, however important they are to programming more generally. 

- *Clarify Concepts vs. Syntax* (Where Possible). I assume that my students know nothing about programming. I try to note when an idiom is specific to CoffeeScript, JavaScript and CoffeeScript, or to programming langauges in general.
