		â€¢ Basic Triggered Animation

######################## P1
# Any UI development framework should include a way to animate things.
# Framer is no exeption. 
# Framer layers have an animation method. 
# You call the method and pass it an object with details about the animation.
# Framer will change the layer's properties, over time, to match the details object.
# The details object is a kind of 'animation target' or 'keyframe data'.
# You can think of this approach as 'fire and forget'. (This is common in many animation systems.)


box = new Layer
box.animate({x:300,y:300}) 


######################## P1.a
# Same as above, but using shortcuts. 
# This is super common and we'll use this approach hereafter

box = new Layer
box.animate
	x:300
	y:300

######################## P2
# The details object can include an options property that contains more animation details.
# Two common options are time and delay. 
# Time is the duration of the animation and delay is, well, a delay.

box = new Layer

box.animate						
	scale:1.2 		
	rotation:45				# Rotation is in degrees
	backgroundColor:"#ff0000"
	options:
		time:0.5			# The animation will last for 1/2 a second.
		delay:2 			# The animation will start in 2 seconds.  		

# There are more options in the documentation. (cmd+D)


######################## P3
# Animations are commonly used inside of event handler functions.

box = new Layer

box.onMouseDown ->						
	@animate							# Remember, '@' means 'this.' and 'this' refers to the Layer that emitted the event. 
		rotation:180 + @rotation		# When the handler function runs, '@animate' translates to 'box.animate'


######################## P4
# Calling layer.animate() while the layer is already animating can cancel the previous animation.
# This can be useful.
# Try rolling over and out of the box quickly.

box = new Layer
	x : 100
	y : 100

box.onMouseOver ->
	@animate	
		scale:2
		options:
			time:3		
			
box.onMouseOut ->
	@animate
		scale:1
		options:
			time:3


######################## P5
# Any animation system must "interpolate" between the starting value and the end values of an animation. 
# Interpolation is when a set of values between two values are calculated using an equation.
# Different equations can be used for interpolation. 
# Different equations result in different sets of values that lead to different looks, or easing, to an animated change. 
# Because of this, sometimes theseequations are called "easing equations". 
# The values of these equations, when graphed, will look like different kinds of curves: 
# Because of this, "easing equations" are sometimes just called "curves".
# In animation software, like After effects, you adjust these curves by hand.
# Many UI frameworks provide a set of premade options.
# Framer's options include: "ease-in", "ease-out", "ease-in-out".
# There are more options in the documentation.


box1 = new Layer
box2 = new Layer
	y:200

box3 = new Layer
	y:400


box1.onMouseDown ->			# I put these animations in the mouse down handler so you have control over triggering them.
	box1.animate
		x:400
		options:
			curve:"ease-in"			

	box2.animate
		x:400
		options:
			curve:"ease-out"
			
	box3.animate
		x:400
		options:
			curve:"ease-in-out"
